miciek's problem-hunting
========================

This is the project that is used by me in different algorithmic contests and websites. Currently it has solutions to problems from:

- http://uva.onlinejudge.org/ (see my stats @ http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/id/29922)

Links to problem definitions can be found in the code.
